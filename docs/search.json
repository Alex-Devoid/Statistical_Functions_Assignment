    "text": "Task 1: Conceptual Questions\n\nWhat is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?\nlapply() applies a function over a list or vector and returns a list of the same length. The equivalent function in the purrr package is map(), which also returns a list.\nSuppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want to use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = \"kendall\") on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (I’m really trying to ask you how you specify method = \"kendall\" when calling lapply()\nmy_list &lt;- list(\n  data.frame(a = rnorm(10), b = rnorm(10)),\n  data.frame(a = rnorm(10), b = rnorm(10))\n)\n\nresult &lt;- lapply(my_list, function(x) cor(x, method = \"kendall\"))\nWhat are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?\n\npurrr functions have a consistent syntax and naming convention, making the code easier to read and write.\npurrr functions provide better error handling and more options for managing complex data, like nested lists.\n\nWhat is a side-effect function?\nA side-effect function performs an action beyond returning a value. For example, modifying a global variable.\nWhy can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?\nThe scope of a variable inside a function is limited to that function. Naming a variable sd within a function does not interfere with the global sd function because R can differentiate between the local variable and the global function.\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Writing R Functions\n\nWrite a basic function (call it getRMSE()) that takes in a vector of responses and a vector of predictions and outputs the RMSE.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\ngetRMSE &lt;- function(actual, predicted, ...) {\nsqrt(mean((actual - predicted)^2, ...))\n}\n\n\nRun the following code to create some response values and predictions.
