<h1>Task 1: Conceptual Questions</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>What is the purpose of the <code>lapply()</code> function? What is the equivalent <code>purrr</code> function?</strong></p>
<p><code>lapply()</code> applies a function over a list or vector and returns a list of the same length. The equivalent function in the <code>purrr</code> package is <code>map()</code>, which also returns a list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suppose we have a list called <code>my_list</code>. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want to use <code>lapply()</code> to run the code <code>cor(numeric_matrix, method = "kendall")</code> on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (I’m really trying to ask you how you specify <code>method = "kendall"</code> when calling <code>lapply()</code></strong></p>

<li><p><strong>What are two advantages of using <code>purrr</code> functions instead of the BaseR apply family?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>purrr</code> functions have a consistent syntax and naming convention, making the code easier to read and write.</li>
<li><code>purrr</code> functions provide better error handling and more options for managing complex data, like nested lists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>What is a side-effect function?</strong></p>
<p>A side-effect function performs an action beyond returning a value. For example, modifying a global variable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why can you name a variable <code>sd</code> in a function and not cause any issues with the <code>sd</code> function?</strong></p>
<p>The scope of a variable inside a function is limited to that function. Naming a variable <code>sd</code> within a function does not interfere with the global <code>sd</code> function because R can differentiate between the local variable and the global function.</p></li>
